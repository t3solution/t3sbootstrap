				<source>'Standard' is the most common Page Type and is used for normal webpages.
'Backend User Section' is an option which creates pages that are only visible in the Frontend for Backend users who are logged in.

&lt;b&gt;Link&lt;/b&gt;
'Shortcut' pages jump to another page in the Pagetree.
'Mount Point' pages bring content from another branch of the Pagetree into the current branch.
'Link to External URL' is similar to 'Shortcut' but points to external URLs instead of TYPO3 pages.

&lt;b&gt;Special&lt;/b&gt;
'Folder' is a page type which is not shown as a webpage but is instead stores records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in the Recycler are not visible in the Frontend.
'Menu Separator' is only useful if your Frontend menus are programmed to use it. It does not represent a page with content but is intended to be an unclickable placeholder in the menu.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt; Each Page Type is represented by a unique icon. The available page types can be restricted for users so all of the options described above may not be visible. Finally, particular record types may only be allowed on certain page types, but any record can be placed in a 'Folder.'</source>

				<source>The Link Target overrides the default Link Target behavior, which should already be configured correctly for most pages in the website TypoScript template.
There are additional options available by using the Link Target field

Setting an integer value at the beginning of the field sets it as the default type for the page.
For example, if an RSS feed is configured in TypoScript as typeNum=100, setting the Link Target to 100 could be used to add an RSS link in the menu.

The following syntax is used to open the page in a popup window:
400x200 - Opens the page in a 400x200 popup window.
230x450:resizable=0,location=1 - Opens the page in a 230x450 popup window that is not resizable and has an address bar.

Combined:
100 600x350 - Opens the page in a 600x350 popup with type=100
2 _blank - Opens the page with target "_blank" and type=2</source>

Marking a page as containing a 'Shop' plugin simply means it'll show up in the shortcut list of modules in the backend.

In addition, the description will be displayed if you create a Content Element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt;. If an abstract exists for the page, it will be used instead of the description.

If you create a Content Element of type &lt;i&gt;Sitemap&lt;/i&gt; and then choose &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt; an overview of pages will be created. If an abstract is available for a page it will be used instead of the description.
